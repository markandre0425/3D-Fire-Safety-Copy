## üîß Step-by-Step Manual Integration

If you want to manually integrate specific components:

### Option 1: Replace Character Component

```tsx
// In GameScreen.tsx or Level.tsx
import EnhancedCharacter from '../game/EnhancedCharacter';

// Replace existing Character component
<EnhancedCharacter />
```

### Option 2: Add Physics World

```tsx
// Wrap your scene in PhysicsWorld
import PhysicsWorld from '../game/PhysicsWorld';

<PhysicsWorld>
  {/* Your existing game components */}
  <Level />
</PhysicsWorld>
```

### Option 3: Enhanced Camera Controls

```tsx
// Replace OrbitControls with EnhancedCameraControls
import EnhancedCameraControls from '../game/EnhancedCameraControls';

// Remove OrbitControls and PerspectiveCamera
// Add:
<EnhancedCameraControls />
```

### Option 4: Enhanced Mobile Controls

```tsx
// In App.tsx, replace MobileControls with:
import EnhancedMobileControls from './components/game/EnhancedMobileControls';

{isMobile && (
  <EnhancedMobileControls />
)}
```
